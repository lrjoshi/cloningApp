# cloningApp

This Shiny App helps to you design primers for DNA cloning. You have to provide raw DNA sequence and choose the desired restrction enzymes. The app will generate both forward and reverse primers. Also, the app adds five extra base pairs at the 3' end of the primers which are needed for precise cutting by the restriction enzymes. The app also lets to to choose the number of base pairs you want to keep in the primers. You can choose between 18-100 bp.

This app also checks if the restriction sites are already present in the input DNA sequence. If the restriction sites are present then you might need to change the enzyme. You can also see the cleavage site and pattern of the selected enzyme.
